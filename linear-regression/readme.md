# Linear Regression for Command Prediction

Let me explain each step of the code:

1. **Dataset Generation**:
   - Created a list of common terminal commands
   - Replicated them to create a larger dataset
   - Included various command types (file operations, system queries, etc.)

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Split commands into words
   - Created input sequences (all words except last) and targets (last word)
   - Padded sequences to uniform length

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Used OneHotEncoder to convert text to numerical features
   - Created separate encoders for input and target words
   - Flattened and combined encoded sequences

4. **Model Creation**:
   - Used sklearn's LinearRegression
   - Split data into training and test sets
   - Trained the model on encoded data

5. **Prediction Function**:
   - Takes input sequence
   - Processes and encodes it
   - Returns predicted next word

To use this code, you'll need to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn tensorflow aiofiles gradio seaborn --user --upgrade --break-system-packages
```

The model has several limitations:

1. It's a simple linear regression model, so it won't capture complex patterns
2. The synthetic dataset is small and limited
3. It doesn't handle unseen commands well
4. The padding might affect prediction quality

Would you like me to explain any particular part in more detail or make any improvements to the model?

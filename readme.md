# Mini Terminal Assistant

This project explores the development of a mini terminal assistant model using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a model capable of predicting terminal commands based on input sequences, thereby assisting with command-line tasks. The project currently includes a linear regression approach, with plans to implement other models for comparison and improvement.

## Overview

The Mini Terminal Assistant Model is designed to predict command-line commands based on partial input, aiming to assist users by suggesting the next probable command.

### Current and Planned Models

1. **Linear Regression (Baseline Model)**:
   - A basic linear regression model trained on synthetic command-line data.
   - This model provides a foundation by learning simple relationships between command sequences.
   - Located in the `linear-regression` directory, this model demonstrates the feasibility of command prediction with minimal complexity.

2. **Future Model Plans**:
   - **Logistic Regression**: To evaluate classification-based command predictions.
   - **Naive Bayes**: To use probabilistic modeling on command sequences.
   - **Decision Trees and Random Forests**: For handling non-linear relationships.
   - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: LSTMs or GRUs, which can better capture sequential patterns in command sequences.
   - **Transformer Models**: Implement a transformer-based approach to handle longer sequences and contextual command prediction.

### Dataset

The current model uses a synthetic dataset of typical terminal commands, including tasks like file operations (`cp`, `mv`), navigation (`cd`, `ls`), and system commands (`df`, `ps`). This dataset is expanded by replicating command sequences, but future versions will use more extensive and varied datasets to improve generalizability.

## Usage

Each model has its own implementation within a separate directory, with scripts for training and testing. To run the current linear regression model:

```bash
cd linear-regression
python main.py
```

This script will:

- Train a linear regression model on the synthetic dataset.
- Output the model's training and test performance.
- Run a sample prediction, displaying an input command sequence and the modelâ€™s suggested next command word.
